# 📱🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis 💬
**Decoding emotions, one tweet at a time.**

Every second, thousands of people share their thoughts on Twitter about politics, products, movies, and life itself.  
But what if you could *instantly* understand the mood behind all those tweets?  
This project transforms noisy, unstructured Twitter text into clear **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** insights using the power of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.

## 📖 What is this project about?

This project is a **Twitter Sentiment Analysis pipeline** built with Python.  
It processes real tweets, cleans the text, converts them into machine-readable features, and applies ML models to determine their sentiment.

We combine:
- 🧹 **Data preprocessing** — cleaning up the chaos of raw tweets  
- 🧠 **Text vectorization** — turning words into numerical features  
- 🤖 **ML models** — training classifiers to detect sentiment  
- 📊 **Visualization** — showing trends, patterns, and word usage

## 🧠 Why I built this

In the age of social media, public opinion moves faster than ever.  
Businesses, researchers, and policymakers can no longer afford to guess what people think. They need real-time, data-driven sentiment insights.

I wanted to create a tool that:
- Helps brands track customer satisfaction 💼  
- Enables researchers to measure public mood 📚  
- Lets anyone explore *how the internet feels* in a given moment 🌎

## 📦 Dataset

📥 **Dataset Source:** [Sentiment140 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

Contains **1.6 million tweets** labeled as:
- `0` — Negative 😡  
- `2` — Neutral 😐  
- `4` — Positive 😄  

Files used:
- `twitter_data.csv` — Tweets and sentiment labels

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: \[Insert dataset source or link]
* **Description**: This dataset contains tweets labeled with sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
* **Size**: \[Insert number of records]
* **Features**:

  * `text` – The tweet content
  * `sentiment` – The sentiment label assigned to the tweet

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Loading** – Load dataset and perform initial inspection.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Remove URLs, punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.
3. **Tokenization** – Split tweets into individual tokens (words).
4. **Visualization** – Generate word clouds and sentiment distribution plots.
5. **Feature Extraction** – Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical form.
6. **Model Training** – Apply machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
7. **Evaluation** – Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | \[xx%]   | \[xx%]    | \[xx%] | \[xx%]   |
| Naive Bayes         | \[xx%]   | \[xx%]    | \[xx%] | \[xx%]   |

*(Replace `[xx%]` with actual values from your results.)*
